## Introduction

Competitive programming is a mind sport that requires solving well-defined algorithmic and computational problems. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to such problems from various online platforms.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:


- **Platform-N**: Each competitive programming platform has its own folder.
    - **Solution.ext**: The solution file for the corresponding problem in the programming language of your choice (e.g., Solution.py, Solution.java).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions based on the platform and problem you are interested in. If you have alternative solutions or want to add solutions from new platforms, contributions are welcome!

## License

Happy Coding!
